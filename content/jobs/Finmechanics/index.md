- Developed a **service orchestration and management utility** capable of starting and terminating services based on their interdependencies.
- Ensured that when initiating a specific service, all its dependencies are launched first before the given service, and similarly, when terminating a service, all dependent services are terminated prior to the main service.
- Implemented live status reporting for all services within the utility.
- Created a **Java Spring Boot** back-end to facilitate seamless communication with the orchestration utility and handle API calls from the front-end.
- Designed and developed a user-friendly Application Dashboard Frontend using **React.js**, enabling smooth interaction with the Spring Boot backend through **Axios API calls**.
